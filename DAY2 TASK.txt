
Difference between document and window object:

The window object and the document object are two of the most important objects in the browserâ€™s JavaScript environment. The window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page, while the document object represents the web page itself.

The document object is a property of the window object. It represents the web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access elements in the HTML page and add dynamic content to our web page.

On the other hand, the window object contains properties and methods that control the behavior of the browser 1. It is also a global object in a browser, and it can be treated as the root of the document object model.


	Here are some of the differences between these two objects:

		1. The window object is a global object that represents a browser window or tab, while the document object represents a web page loaded in that window or tab.
		2. The window object has properties and methods that control the behavior of the browser, while the document object provides access to content and elements on a web page.
		3. The window object is a parent to all other objects in JavaScript, including document, while document is a child of window.
